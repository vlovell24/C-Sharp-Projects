A scoring calculator

This is a problem taken from Hacker Rank. 

Erica and Bob are beginning programmers. Each of them is given ONE question a day to answer. If they get it right, it is entered into a string. The questions are entered via difficulty. "E" is easy, "M" is medium and "H" is hard. Each of the difficulties has a different rank. "E" is 1, "M" is 2 and "H" is 3. 

Given a string with the letters E, A and M; calculate erica and bobs scores, and declare a winner. 

If erica's string is "EEE", then her score would be 3.
If bob's string is "HEM", then his score is 6. 

In this case, bob would be the winner. 

Erica and Bob will always have an equal string.
