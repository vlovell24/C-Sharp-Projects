Number Guesser Game

A simple guessing game. First, a random number between one and ten is generated by the program. Then, the player is given five "guesses" to figure out the correct answer. If the player is correct, the program displays "Your Correct" and terminates the program. If the player is incorrect, the program displays "try again", and the player is allowed another try. If the player uses up all of their five tries, then the program displays "You ran out of guesses" and terminates. If the player happens to input anything other than a number, a catch error is thrown that displays "Must be a number, try again", and they are then allowed to try to input a number. 

The random number that is chosen by the computer is hard coded to be between 1 and 10, however, it can be changed to anything. Guesses are also hard coded into the compareGuess method, but again, it can be changed to anything, or removed entirely (making a game with endless guessing).
